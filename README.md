# QGIS Python Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Python scripting in QGIS to extract airport data from a shapefile and save it to a text file. It's a beginner-friendly introduction to Python scripting in QGIS.

## How to Use

1. **Download the airports shapefile**: Download the airports shapefile from [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/airports/).

2. **Load the shapefile in QGIS**: Open QGIS and load the airports shapefile.

3. **Execute the Python script**: Open the Python console (Plugins -> Python Console) and execute the provided Python script `readData.py`.

4. **Check the output file**: Check the root directory for the generated `airports.txt` file containing airport data.
